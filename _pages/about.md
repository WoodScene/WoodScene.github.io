I am a second-year PhD student at Department of Computing, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao-Ming Wu](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/).
Prior to that, I obtained my Master degree from [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yasha Wang](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/wangyasha/zh_CN/more/10532/jsjjgd/index.htm) and Bachelor degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai (HIT)](https://www.hitwh.edu.cn/).

# Research Interests
I have broad interests in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in its integration with Large Language Models. My primary research focuses on dialog systems, including tasks such as dialogue state tracking (DST).  

Previously, during my master's studies, I did some research on spatial-temporal data imputation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).
