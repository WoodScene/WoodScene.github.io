I am a second-year PhD student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao-Ming Wu](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxmwu/).
Prior to that, I obtained my Master degree from Peking University (PKU) under the supervision of [Prof. Yasha Wang](https://faculty.pku.edu.cn/wangyasha/zh_CN/more/10532/jsjjgd/index.htm) and Bachelor degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai (HIT).
